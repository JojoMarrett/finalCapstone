**Capstone Project**
This project performs sentiment analysis on textual data using SpaCy and SpaCyTextBlob. The importance of this project lies in its ability to automatically analyse the sentiment of text, which can be valuable for businesses in understanding customer feedback, social media sentiment, and other text-based data. It preprocesses the text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and converting words to lowercase. It then utilizes SpaCy's sentiment analysis capabilities to determine the sentiment polarity of each text.
